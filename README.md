We plea for your help to improve the quality and coverage of the responses from the copilot. The main challenge that is facing us now is to collect reliable sources of information. Ideally pdf files published by goverments and reputable instituations. Those pdf files wil be used to expand the knowledge of our copilot. 

In order to suggest a file, make a PR to the data folder, put in the comment a link to the source of the file and we will add it to our index.
